A Dataset for Verification of Real-World Climate Claims

## Questions & Answers

Question:

`I want to ask if it is possible to make more research on some, or do I have to stick with the article provided and my common sense.`

Answer:

No, you need to stick to the context provided and your common sense. This is in-fact the core idea of the dataset. It can then be used to test a machine learning algorithm, that sees exactly the same as you did while doing the annotation. It is equally important that the machine learning algorithm then can predict “not enough information” if it thinks that the context given by the evidence sentence along with its “common sense” is not enough to validate the claim.

Short answer:

No, you have to stick to the context provided (evidence sentence) and your common sense to validate the claim (support/refute). If you feel that not enough info is provided you must choose this third option.
